# Exploring GDP Contributions by Industry (1987–1997)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global GDP contributions by industry sector between 1987 and 1997 using Microsoft Excel. Completed as part of Codecademy's Excel for Data Analysis course, the goal was to clean raw economic data, identify trends in industry contributions to GDP, and visualize shifts in economic structure across countries and over the decade.

Key tasks included data cleaning, pivot tables for aggregation, conditional formatting, and creating charts to highlight industry dominance and growth patterns.

## File Description
File Name: exploring-data-project.xlsx

The workbook contains multiple sheets:
- Raw data import and cleaning
- Pivot tables summarizing GDP by industry and year
- Charts and dashboards showing trends and comparisons

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets (Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, Advanced Charting, Data Cleaning, Statistical Functions).

## Key Findings
- **Dominant Sectors**: Manufacturing and Services consistently contributed the largest shares to GDP in most developed economies, while Agriculture showed declining relative importance over the period.
- **Sector Growth Trends**: The Services sector exhibited the strongest growth in contribution across many countries, reflecting the shift toward service-based economies.
- **Regional Variations**: Emerging markets showed higher contributions from Agriculture and Manufacturing early in the period, with gradual diversification by 1997.
- **Strategic Insight**: Understanding industry contributions helps identify economic strengths and potential areas for policy focus or investment.
